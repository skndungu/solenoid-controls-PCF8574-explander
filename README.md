- Download the codes from the codes from the ⬇️ on the code section, you will get a folder with the name 📁 `solenoid-controls-PCF8574-explander-master`
- Extract the content of the zipped file, you will get the firmware codes and another folder with the name 📁 `libs` extract the content from the folder and paste it on your 📂 `documents/Arduino/library/` directory to add the lib used in this case
- Compile and run codes
- Upload to the dev board and test out your codes!
